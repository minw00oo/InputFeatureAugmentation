# InputFeatureAugmentation

## Abstract

When unidirectional (UD) composites break, their cross-sections reveal intricate fracture patterns influenced by fiber volume and distribution, reflecting its ability to resist the applied mechanical load. Finite element analysis (FEA) for every configuration is computationally demanding. To address this, the research integrates deep learning (DL), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A new approach includes Mori-Tanaka (MT) homogenization predictions or normalized stress fields (NSF) as multi-modal input to cover a wider volume fraction (VF) range. This enhances the correlation between structural features and mechanical properties. The model was compared to traditional CNNs and those with additional features. NSF-enhanced models showed superior prediction across new VF ranges, making mechanical behavior prediction more efficient.
